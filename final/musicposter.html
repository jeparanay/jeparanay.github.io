              <h3>Music Poster</h3>
              <p> For this assignment, I was asked to choose a song, and design a poster for it.
                The poster was to be designed mimicking the style of a designer off of a list   that was provided to us. I created this music poster for the song Only Time by Enya. This beautiful song reminds us that you donâ€™t know where your life will lead you, so relax, go with the flow, and time will unveil your path. My poster expresses the serene feeling you get from listening to this song. The design was Inspired by designer Lance Goines.
