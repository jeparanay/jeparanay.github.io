              <p> For this assignment I chose Harry Houdini, a famous magician. Using his 
                initials, I created a wood monument which reflects on what he is most famous for; his escapes. The monument is interactive and moves using a system of slots and pins. It begins as a single H that expands; each H representing the progress of his escapes. The final H at the end pops out to show him breaking free of the obstacles he overcomes from completing his escape.The person (measuring 5ft tall at life size) represents the scale of the monument if it were in actual size. If the monument was built to its larger scale, it would be displayed in achildrens museum and allow children to interact with the monument and learn about the famous magician Harry Houdini.
